#### Q1.There are 10 people. What are the number of ways in which you can split them into a team of 6 and a team of 4? Additionally, what are the number of ways in which you can split them into two teams of 5 each?

#### Answer 1:

-   Number of ways to split the 10 people in teams of 6 and 4 are
    <sup>10</sup>*C*<sub>6</sub>  =  <sup>10</sup>*C*<sub>4</sub>
-   Number of ways to split the 10 people in teams of 5 and 5 are
    <sup>10</sup>*C*<sub>5</sub>/2. This is because the two groups are
    identical in number. Thus, division by 2.

#### Q2. Prove P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) − P(A ∩ B). Hint: The goal is to prove this mathematically (not using Venn diagrams). Try writing A ∪ B as union of three disjoint sets and then apply axiom 3 that we discussed in class.

#### Answer 2:

-   Partitioning a Set: For every two sets *A* and *B*, *B* and
    *A* ∩ *B*<sup>*c*</sup> are disjoint.
