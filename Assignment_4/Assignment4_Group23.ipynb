    "#### Q6. (optional) Birth Month Paradox Advanced Version - In the above question, we assumed that the probability of being born in any month is equal. Historically, month of August has seen the largest number of births compared to any other month. If we were to incorporate this new information, say probability of being born in August is p and probability of being born in any other month is q. What would be your approach to solving the above problem with this new information? Hint : The trick here would still be to write the probabilities in terms of its complementary event. Try enumerating possible combinations and compute the probability using the non-uniform distribution.<br>"
